# Intro to *x
- Unix, Linux, OS X, and all of the Unix-like operating systems

## What?
An operating system is what your computer uses to run the most basic tasks; it's what everything else is built upon. A Unix-like OS is any OS that behaves like Unix with the same (or similar) commands and shell.

## Why *x?
Also known as *nix, Unix-like systems are incredibly popular, especially within the development community. The majority of the web servers in the world run Linux operating systems, and so do a lot of enterprise systems. Many development tools are developed for Unix-like systems before being ported to Windows. Generally you will run into fewer problems coding with a Unix-like environment than a Windows environment.

## Cool, how do I get started?
1. Get out your USB drive. If you don't have one, partner up with someone who has one.
2. Get out your laptop. If you don't have one, partner up with someone who has one.
3. If on Mac or Linux
    - You're already running a Unix-like operating system! Good job.
4. If on Windows:
5. Download [Rufus USB Installer](https://rufus.akeo.ie/)
6. Download the Puppy Linux .iso file from [here](http://distro.ibiblio.org/puppylinux/puppy-slacko-6.3.0/32/slacko-6.3.0.iso)
7. Follow these [instructions](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows), except we'll be installing Puppy Linux instead of Ubuntu.
8. Restart your computer and boot into Puppy Linux.
9. When you are booted in: **do not** eject the USB.
10. Stand up and draw an animal (and write your name) on the board.

If you have any questions, just call me over.
- Ex: 
    * You: "Yo yo yo, Naitian. This be throwing an error."
    * Me: "Fo' sho', lemme take a look."
